# Introduction

This is a single-page to-do application that allows users to keep track of their tasks. Users have access to full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for each of their tasks.

# Technologies used

This application was built using Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js, react-router-dom, and ViteJS

# Unsolved Problems
- Date conversion (SOLVED)
- Placeholder text for edit 
# Future Enhancements

- Redirect the page when the user makes a new task and when the user updates a task instead of sending an alert
- Maybe a different kind of way to keep track, like a checklist
- Adding the ability to add different tasks in one list
- Show an error message when the user info is incorrect
